Don's Switch-breaker-in-er-er

https://youtu.be/BkM8NjMfSCg

This project produces a simple switch breaker system that can wear-in mechanical keyboard switches using rotational force and eliptical cams.
The primary chasis is two 3D printed parts, a motor plate and raack, where two motor plates are required, supported by up to 8 racks.
Each rack holds four switches for a total of 32 switches in this arrangement.
The assembly is driven with a reduction-geared driveshaft connected to a small 12V DC motor capable of 120RPM.
The cams are threaded onto the drive shaft and held in place with loctite and M4 nuts on either side of the cams.

Build of Materials.
1x 12V DC motor (Machfit GA12N20-M4100:

1x Power Supply (

2x Power Leads with clips, or wires soldered to DC motor.
2x Motor Plates
4x Cam 2 Sided
8x M4 Nuts
8x Switch Rack
32x DSA keycaps (these will be worn over time by the mechanism)

Slight adjustments to Motor Plates for hole to fit the DC motor and drive shaft may be required, such as sanding/widening the hole.

If the fit of the racks to the plate is loose, elastic or rubber bands may be used to hold the racks against the motor plate.

It is highly recommended to have pairs of racks in opposite positions for balancing purposes.

Don is unable to take responsibility for the longevity of the above DC motor and its duration of continous run-time, as it has not been tested to long durations.

Good Heat management of the DC motor may affect its longevity and continuous use.
